✅ **Repetitive metaphors** – (_"navigating the landscape," "journey of transformation"_)  
✅ **Formulaic transitions** – (_"Furthermore," "Moreover," "In conclusion"_)  
✅ **Exaggerated emphasis** – (_"This is crucially important!"_)  
✅ **Vague positive descriptors** – (_"highly effective," "incredibly useful"_)
